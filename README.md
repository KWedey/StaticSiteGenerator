## Formatting Ideas

I just want to be able to write a paragraph that's indented and compliant with typical academic requirements

    Test this message is indented in Markdown. how far does this block extend? I just wanted one line

so that the formatting may be corect? Except that it's not.... which is kind of a problem for me.
